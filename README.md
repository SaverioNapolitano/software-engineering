# Software Engineering

In this repository, you can find my exercises for the software engineering exam:

* **uml** for various types of diagrams
* **design patterns** for some simple Java applications that implement them

## Table of contents

* [designPatterns](#design-patterns)
* [uml](#uml-diagrams)
* [requirements](#requirements)

## Design patterns

Here you can find Java implementations of some design patterns seen through the course.

If the exercises focus on a specific design pattern, it has its own package, while the exercises that involve more design patterns have been placed in the **mixed** package.

Each package is named after the design pattern it implements.

## Uml diagrams

In this directory, you can find examples of some uml diagrams.

In the **exercises** folder, there are the solutions to some exercises taken from the slides that have not been discussed in class.
Each package under exercises is named after the uml diagram that it contains.

In the **exams** folder, there are the solutions to some past exams; each subfolder represents a past exam and is named after its date.
Within each subfolder, you can find the corresponding uml diagrams, each named after its type.

## Requirements

The project is made using: 

* IntelliJ Community Edition
* Java 17

To see the uml diagrams properly you will need additional plugins:

* diagrams.net (formerly draw.io) plugin
* plantuml plugin
